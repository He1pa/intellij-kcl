# KCL Plugin for IntelliJ IDEA

The KCL IntelliJ IDEA plugin provides rich language support for the [KCL language](https://kcl-lang.io/).

In addition, we also have a plugin implemented based on the LSP(Language Server Protocol), which can be found [here](https://github.com/kcl-lang/intellij-kcl-lsp)

## Quick Start

Welcome to KCL developing! We hope this plugin enhances your development experience with KCL.

- **Step 1.** [Install KCL](https://kcl-lang.io/docs/user_docs/getting-started/install) on your system.

- **Step 2.** Install the KCL plugin for IntelliJ IDEA in Marketplace. Preference -> plugins -> Marketplace -> search `KCL` -> install -> restart IDE. This plugin requires the IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate 2023.2+

- **Step 3.** Open or create a KCL file and begin your KCL tour!
